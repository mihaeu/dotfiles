# Mike's Dotfiles

> I use these dotfiles on various unix systems to get me up an running. While I didn't spend time on making things work for others, I think it might still be useful as an example for those who want to play around with the nix package manager.

## Getting started

```bash
# required curl and perl
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mihaeu/dotfiles/master/bootstrap | sh
```

After that you should be ready to go. If not, please file an issue.
